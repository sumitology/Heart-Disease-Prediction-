# Heart Disease Prediction Project 🚀

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction Project! This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on various health-related features. 🚀

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a user-friendly prediction system.

### Key Features:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 🧹
- Model Training with Logistic Regression and Random Forest 🌟
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve 📊
- Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV 🔍
- Interactive User Input for Predictions 🛠️

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

 ```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
 ```

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
    cd heart-disease-prediction
    ```

2. **Download the dataset:**

    Ensure that the dataset file (`heart_disease_data.csv`) is placed in the `content/drive/My Drive/` directory or update the path in the code accordingly.

3. **Run the code:**

    Open the `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially.

## 📋 Code Explanation

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
   - Scale features for better model performance.

2. **Model Training:**
   - **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for binary classification.
   - **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble model with hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
   - Visualize performance metrics to understand model effectiveness.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Interactive input system for real-time predictions based on user-provided data.
